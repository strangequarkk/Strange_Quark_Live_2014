This is included with or in comparison with music, and male humpback whales have been described as &quot;inveterate composers&quot; of songs that are &quot;â€™strikingly similar' to human musical traditions&quot;. The click sounds made by sperm whales and dolphins are not strictly song, but the clicking sequences have been suggested to be individualized rhythmic sequences that communicate the identity of a single whale to other whales in its group and allows the groups to coordinate foraging activities.",
